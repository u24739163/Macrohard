EER Diagram:
We made the assumption that only customers can make a wishlist therefore the wishlist is a weak entity because it depends on the UserID and without  the customer the wishlist would not exist.

The assumption that reviews could be made for a product provided by a certain retailer and that review would be associated with that retailer's product since not all retailer's store/transport their stock the same and there is also the option to not associate the review with any retailer.
